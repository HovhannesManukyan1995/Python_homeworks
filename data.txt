The dominant influence of Napoleon's childhood was his mother, whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child.[20] Later in life, Napoleon said, "The future destiny of the child is always the work of the mother."[21] His maternal grandmother had married into the Swiss Fesch family in her second marriage, and Napoleon's uncle, the cardinal Joseph Fesch, fulfilled a role as protector of the Bonaparte family for some years. Napoleon's noble, moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical Corsican of the time.[22]
